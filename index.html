            <p class="biography-text">Muhammad Ali Jinnah was born on 25 December 1876 in Karachi into a Kasana family of Ismaili Shia Islam. At the time, the city was a small port town in the Sindh region of British India. Jinnah's family was from a Gujarati Ismaili background, though Jinnah later followed the Twelver Shia sect. His father, Jinnahbhai Poonja, was a prosperous Gujarati merchant who had moved to Sindh from Kathiawar, Gujarat before Jinnah's birth. His mother was Mithibai, who died shortly after his birth  Jinnah had six siblings: three brothers and three sisters, including his younger sister Fatimah Jinnah.</p>

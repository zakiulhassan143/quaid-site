## ✨ About the Project

This website is a heartfelt tribute to the founder of Pakistan — *Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah*.  
I started building it on **14th August 2024**, aiming to do something meaningful on Pakistan’s Independence Day. The goal was simple: to honor Jinnah’s legacy by presenting his life, quotes, and messages through a clean and respectful digital space.

## 📌 Features

- 🧠 **Early Education Section** – A short overview of Jinnah's early education (more will be added later).
- 🎤 **Major Speeches** – Discover impactful speeches that shaped Pakistan’s journey.
- 💬 **Famous Quotes** – Get inspired by Quaid’s timeless words.
- 🖱️ **Interactive Design** – Headings and elements include hover animations for a modern user experience.
- 📩 **Contact Form** – Reach out with your thoughts or messages of unity.
- 💖 **Beautiful Design** – Built with love and minimal styling to keep the focus on content.

> **Note:** Some buttons are already working, while others will be functional in future updates. Stay tuned for more improvements!


## 🛠️ Built With

- **HTML & CSS** – The backbone of the site, written from scratch.
- **Pure Code Only** – No frameworks, no libraries — just clean and raw HTML & CSS.
- **Basic Animations & Hover Effects** – Added using only CSS for a more engaging experience.
- **VS Code** – Code editor used throughout the project.
- **Microsoft Edge** – For live preview while developing.
- **Canva** – Used to design the hero image, logo, and other visuals.

## 🔮 What's Coming Next?

This is just the beginning. I plan to:
- Expand the **education and biography** section with more detailed info.
- Add more verified details with proper **citations**.
- Include more **images** and historical references.
- Improve the **UI design** and interactivity over time.
